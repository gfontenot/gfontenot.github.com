      <dt>Summary</dt>

      <dd>
        <p>
          I'm an <strong>experienced iOS developer</strong>, going back to
          iPhone OS 3. I have built numerous apps for numerous clients of all
          different shapes and sizes. I enjoy trying to find interesting
          solutions to common problems, and try to push Swift and iOS to their
          limits in persuit of clean code. I have also built open source
          software for use on iOS/macOS that has been used by developers across
          the globe, and has inspired countless other libraries. However, I
          consider "iOS developer" to be a reductive label.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm a <strong>polyglot software developer</strong> interested in
          solving interesting problems in interesting languages. I have extensive
          experience in Objective-C and Swift, but I also have experience in
          Elixir/Phoenix, JavaScript (via React Native), Haskell, and Ruby.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm a <strong>life-long learner</strong>, drawing inspiration and
          education from those around me. I thrive in situations where I have
          to learn new skills to complete my tasks, and I find these
          experiences invigorating.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm also a <strong>life-long educator</strong>, helping to improve
          those around me by way of example. I enjoy working on open source
          work, spreading knowledge by helping end-users with their problems. I
          also enjoy working in heavily colaborative environments,
          collaborating and teaching via code review pull requests.

        <h2>thoughtbot <span>Mobile Development Director, April 2015 - Present</span></h2>

        <p>
          Since April of 2015, I have been acting as the Mobile Development
          Director for thoughtbot. In addition to my duties as a developer, I
          had additional responsibilities.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Managed a team of up to 10 developers across the globe</li>
          <li>Worked as a team advocate</li>
          <li>Assisted in the sales process on behalf of the mobile team</li>
          <li>Performed quarterly reviews with mobile team members</li>
          <li>Performed bi-weekly one on one meetings with mobile team members</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>thoughtbot <span>Developer, September 2013 - Present</span></h2>

        <p>
          I was hired at thoughtbot as part of their initiative to expand into
          the iOS space. Over the years I have worked as a consultant on
          projects in Swift, Objective-C, and React Native for iOS.
          Additionally, I spent time to get up to speed with Elixir and Phoenix
          and have billed on projects using those technologies as well.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Worked with clients to determine the best product needed to fit their needs</li>
          <li>Designed application architectures and built custom visual components, using a test-first methodology</li>
          <li>Designed and maintained tooling to improve the development experience</li>
          <li>Designed and maintained open source libraries to improve the development experience</li>
        </ul>

      <dd>
        <h2><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/argo">Argo</a> <span>Swift</span></h2>
        <p>
          Initially created as an experimentation of Swift's type system and
          improving the JSON parsing experience in Swift, Argo has turned into
          a more general applicative parser for moving from loosely-typed
          structures into strongly typed ones.
        </p>

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/runes">Runes</a> <span>Swift</span></h2>
        <p>
          A playground of sorts, defining infix operators to be used by other
          libraries (such as Argo) as well as some default implementations for
          the <code>Optional</code> and <code>Array</code> types in the
          standard lib. The test suite has turned into an experimentation with
          using property-based testing to verify the various mathematic laws
          required by conforming to specific interfaces.
        </p>

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/gfontenot/reflow">reflow</a> <span>Haskell</span></h2>
        <p>
          A Haskell command line tool designed to replace <code>fold -s</code>.
          It intelligently rewraps lines, with knowledge of things like code
          blocks, quote blocks, PGP signatures, and plain-text email headers. I
          use it every day to re-format plain text emails to be more readable.
          You can see <a href="https://github.com/gfontenot/dotfiles/blob/master/tag-mutt/config/mutt/plugins/display_filter.sh">the usage in my dotfiles</a>
        </p>

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/gfontenot/vim-xcode">vim-xcode</a> <span>Vimscript</span></h2>
        <p>
          A Vim plugin for working with Xcode projects. I'm constantly trying
          to improve my day-to-day development experience, and a lot of that is
          focused around trying to break free of Xcode's grasp.
          <code>vim-xcode</code> allows me to build, test, and run apps
          directly from within Vim (by wrapping <code>xcodebuild</code>), which
          helps me avoid needing to switch contexts as often.
        </p>

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/curry">Curry</a> <span>Swift</span></h2>
        <p>
          A microframework to bring function currying to Swift. Incredibly
          useful, especially when paired with Argo, where it allows us to curry
          a type's initializer instead of requiring a curried constructor to be
          defined manually. The source for Curry is entirely generated by a
          script.
        </p>

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/swish">Swish</a> <span>Swift</span></h2>
        <p>
          An attempt at building a protocol-oriented networking stack for iOS.
          The goal here was to build a networking lib that was easily testable
          and composable. We also wanted to build something that worked nicely
          with Argo, and returned <code>Result</code> types instead of using
          Swift's error handling.
        </p>

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/gfontenot/featureless-void">Featureless Void</a> <span>Haskell</span></h2>
        <p>
          The source code for <a href="https://micro.gordonfontenot.com">my personal microblog</a>.
          I've been using it as an excuse to learn <a href="https://www.yesodweb.com/">Yesod</a>
          and as a way to do more web work. It includes things like
          authentication, image uploading with S3, Twitter cross-posting, and
          generating RSS/JSON feeds for the content.
        </p>

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/gfontenot/website-source">Personal Website</a> <span>Haskell, HTML, CSS</span></h2>
        <p>
          The source code for <a href="/">my personal website and blog</a>.
          It's a static website generated by <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a>
          and so is largely written in Haskell.
