  <h1>One Year</h1>
  <p>On March 23rd, 2010, I was in a bar with a couple of my friends. After a couple of beers, I began ranting about how I wanted an app on iPhone OS that could help me keep track of the beers I was drinking, along with tasting notes and ratings. It’s possible that I had maybe one beer too many, but when one of my friends suggested that I just build the app myself, I laughed it off and went on with my night. But when I woke up in the morning, it was still there in the back of my head. So on March 24th, 2010, I opened Xcode, started a project from a template, and started teaching myself Objective-C.</p>
<p>What I knew I’d get out of that project was a silly hobby that might make a few dollars. What I hoped for was a basic understanding about how to make applications, and maybe a nice challenge for weekend hacking. What I ended up with was a career change, and a newfound passion.</p>
<p>1 year ago today, I started as a professional iOS developer at <a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a> in Boston, MA. In that past year, I have grown tenfold professionally. I started attending <a href="http://www.cocoaheadsboston.org/">my local CocoaHeads chapter</a> in January, and attended my <a href="http://nsnorth.ca/">first professional conference</a> in April. In June I attended my first <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC</a> … <a href="http://altwwdc.com/">kinda</a>. And at the end of July, I started to <a href="http://buildphase.fm">co-host a podcast</a> with my good friend and colleague, <a href="https://twitter.com/hyperspacemark">Mark Adams</a>.</p>
<p>It’s been a hell of a fucking year. I’ve been almost unbelievably lucky over the past 12 months. <a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com/#our-team">My co-workers</a> are easily the smartest group of people I have ever met in my entire life. The projects I have been able to work on have been incredible learning experiences that have forced me to become a better developer on a daily basis. And for the first time in my life, I’m working in a job that I’m proud to call a career.</p>
<p>Can’t wait to see what happens next.</p>
