    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the hardest things I’ve ever done is quitting smoking. I was never a two pack a day smoker, nor did I smoke for decades, but I was a regular 1/2 pack a day smoker for roughly 6 years (18 - 24). I also know that it’s something I am <em>still</em> addicted to, even though I’ve now quit about as long as I was an active smoker. I still have dreams about smoking, still have cigarette cravings, still have that deep <em>want</em> that doesn’t seem to go away. I’d love nothing more than to go back to smoking. Luckily, there are more important things that I’d rather do like lift weights and taste food. That’s enough to keep me from succumbing to my cravings.</p>
<p>My relationship with <em>alcohol</em> on the other hand, is a bit more… complicated.</p>
<p>Growing up, I was never a drinker. I dropped/got kicked out of college (a story for another time maybe), but not because I was partying (I wasn’t), I just wasn’t good at doing school. It actually wasn’t till I was out of school that I started drinking. But even then, I didn’t really <em>like</em> drinking, I just did it because other people did.</p>
<p>I moved from Texas to Massachusetts the week before my 21st birthday. Being in an unfamiliar environment, trying to meet new friends, alcohol became a way for me to socialize and meet people. I made some good friends, and drinking was just the thing we did. We’d get 40s of <a href="http://pabstbrewingco.com/blog/beer/st-ides/">St. Ides Malt Liquor</a>, get shitfaced, and watch Lost. We’d drink bottles of wine and watch foreign films. We’d drag my little brother (18 at the time) to the sketchy bar down the street and get plastered on Miller High Life (still maybe the worst hangover I’ve ever had). But that was OK, because hey, we were in school and young and partying out of control was the thing to do.</p>
<p>And holy shit, the drunk stories I acquired during that time. For example: I accidentally ran from the cops once. I was walking home drunk and they had reports of someone looking in cars with a flashlight. They stopped me, and when they went to their car I thought they left, so kept walking. About a block later I was surrounded by cop cars and having to answer questions. The cop in charge commented on my “thick Irish accent”, an obviously racist joke I didn’t actually get till like a week later.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years, and I’ve fully embraced craft beer. I am drinking, and I enjoy it. I’ve become a hop-head and start looking for the hoppiest beers I can find. I collect beers, brew beers, read about beers. I’m a full blown beer snob. <a href="http://gordonfontenot.com/blog/one-year">My love for craft beers even led me down my current career path</a>.</p>
<p>And still I acquired stories. Turns out, I’m a fun drunk. I’m an extrovert where I’m normally introverted. I’m funny and I want to talk to people. People like me when I’m drunk. And I can <em>drink</em>, too. I can drink <em>a lot</em>. And so I don’t ever have to be the wet towel that has had enough, the one that needs to go home, the one that ends the night. I can be the last one standing every night.</p>
<p>A few years later and now I’m drinking bourbon. I <em>love</em> bourbon. All bourbon. I drink it straight, or maybe with a single ice cube. I love the bite of the bourbon, the smell, the sweetness. But, it hits me hard. Harder than beer. So something starts to change for me. I’m not just staying out all night anymore, I’m getting much drunker. I’m starting to act erratically, I’m starting to black out fairly regularly.</p>
<p>But hey, I’m still so much <em>fun</em> when I’m drunk. I’ve taken to stealing things when I’m drunk. Not anything serious, but I pick up things that are lying around me. Road cones, signs from hotel lobbies, that kind of thing. Everyone laughs, it’s hilarious, Gordon got drunk and stole another sign from the lobby, great stories.</p>
<hr />
<p>A couple of years ago I started noticing something that really bothered me. I had developed a reputation as a drinker. As <em>the</em> drinker. People make jokes and they mean well, but it starts to land differently. I have a slack notification set up for “beer” and people are using it to get my attention. We have “too much beer” in the office and I’m being counted on to get rid of it. These kinds of things become more and more frequent. Drinking has somehow become part of my identity. And that starts to make me wonder: am I in control here?</p>
<p>I push those questions down, as you do, and move forward. I keep drinking, I keep having fun, people keep liking me. But I’m also fighting with my wife about it more. I come home drunk, sometimes blackout drunk, she gets mad, I apologize, say it won’t happen again, rinse, repeat. I <em>know</em> I’m in control. I have to be in control. How could I not be in control?</p>
<p>So I decide to prove it to myself. I take a month off drinking. It surprises people. They can’t believe that <em>I</em>’m not drinking. But I just say things like “yeah, just taking a break for a while”. No big deal.</p>
<p>At the end of the month, I go back to drinking. I’m fun again. I’m the life of the party again. I’m blacking out again. I’m fighting with my wife again. I’m putting myself in danger again. I’m out of control again.</p>
<p>So I take a break again. See? I’m in control. No big deal. I don’t <em>have</em> to drink. Month ends, back on that horse. Getting blackout drunk and getting lost in New Orleans, missing a night of one of my best friend’s bachelor party. Getting blackout drunk and being too hungover to attend the end of a conference. Getting blackout drunk and stumbling a mile home in the dark and in the snow and sticking a good friend with an $80 Uber bill. Getting blackout drunk and causing my wife to stay up all night to make sure I’m still breathing.</p>
<p>This isn’t fun anymore. These stories aren’t funny anymore. This doesn’t work anymore.</p>
<hr />
<p>I don’t have a drinking problem the way most people think about drinking problems. I don’t get the shakes. I haven’t lost any jobs because I’ve shown up drunk. I’m not struggling keep away from the bottle. I don’t feel the need to avoid alcohol in every form at the risk of going on a bender.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean I don’t have a drinking problem. I’m incapable of saying no. I’m completely unable to walk away from drinking once it’s started. If I have 2 beers, I have 20. If I have one glass of bourbon, I have 10. <em>That</em> is my drinking problem.</p>
<p>So I’m not going to do it anymore. I’m not going to be the funny guy. I’m not going to be the life of the party. I’m not going to be the guy with the stories. But I’m also not going to be the guy apologizing to the people he loves. I’m not going to be the guy that misses things because he’s too hung over. I’m not going to be the guy that puts his life in danger. I’m not going to be the guy out of control.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, this is a relief for me. This is something that I don’t have to worry about anymore. It’s not a question that’s going to plague me every time I wake up after drinking too much.</p>
<p>Am I in control of alcohol? No.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Took me a little bit to get this written up, but I finished up weeks 9 and 10 of StrongLifts.</p>
<p>Week 9:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://gordonfontenot.com/images/StrongLifts/week-9.PNG" />

</div>
<p>Whole bunch of milestones this week.</p>
<p>First up, I finally hit 135 on my overhead press, which means I’m up north of a full plate (45lbs on each side). This lift is really starting to push it for me. I’m happy that I’m finally over a full plate for all of my lifts, but I think I’ll start failing here before too long.</p>
<p>I also crossed the 300lb mark for Deadlift. I didn’t cross into 3 plates (315lbs) until the next week, but crossing over 300lbs means that I cross the arbitrary mark that I set for myself where I start using a switch grip instead of a double overhand grip for deadlifts. Next stop: 405.</p>
<p>Maybe the biggest victory for me this week was breaking the 250lb mark that I used as my 5 rep max back in week one. So that feels fairly major. I can’t say if my one rep max has jumped over the course of this program, but I feel like I have a <em>lot</em> left in the tank, even after crossing this milestone. So that’s probably a good sign. I think I should test my one rep max after these initial 12 weeks are over.</p>
<p>On the flip side of the coin, I started experiencing some knee pain in my right knee this week. I have <em>horrible</em> mobility in my hips and ankles. Always have. It’s something that I’ve been fighting against basically my entire life. On that 300lb deadlift, I noticed that my right knee was far from stable. Getting down into the starting position felt really shaky. I’ll come back to this in a bit.</p>
<p>This marks the (recorded) high watermark thus far, even though I’ve done another week since. I actually did another workout the following Tuesday, hitting 265 in my squat, but I missed the rest of the week, and so I ended up tossing the workout. Following the StrongLifts plan, I deloaded 10%, and came back for week 10:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://gordonfontenot.com/images/StrongLifts/week-10.PNG" />

</div>
<p>Ok, so I didn’t deload <em>everything</em>. I didn’t want to drop back below 300 on deadlift. So there’s actually no record of me hitting 3 plates, instead it looks like I just jumped past 315 and went straight to 325. I still have enough room with this lift that I feel comfortable forging ahead.</p>
<p>The StrongLifts iOS app also added arm work this week. They… didn’t update their layout code unfortunately. The fact that those boxes are cropped in the screenshot wasn’t a mistake on my end, that’s just what it looks like on the device. Super fun.</p>
<p>The arm work adds 3x10 dips to the A workout (squat, bench, row), and 3x10 chinups to the B workout (squat, press, deadlift). The way you’re supposed to do it is max unbroken sets, up to 10 reps. Rest and repeat. I’ve been doing all 10 reps each set, but only scoring the unbroken ones. So for example, that 10/8/5 score on Thursday means I hit 10 unbroken, then 8, then 5. It was the only reasonable way I could think to score it.</p>
<p>The arm work is a real ego buster. I realized how much I suck at chinups today. It’ll be nice to watch this progress.</p>
<p>Following up my knee issues from earlier, I had a minor breakthrough with my squat stance on Thursday. I finally let myself widen my stance about another inch. This puts my feet just outside shoulder width, but also means that my feet don’t get knocked out to the side because of my poor mobility. That keeps my arches from collapsing, and prevents me from putting as much stress on my knees. It’s probably the most stable I’ve ever felt squatting before. I’m still going to fight for better mobility, but it’s nice to know that I don’t have to injure myself to keep progressing.</p>
<p>Like I said, with the exception of deadlifts, I deloaded everything by 10% for this week, so there aren’t really any big milestones here. Week 11 will look a lot like week 9 did, and then we’ll hit some new milestones during week 12.</p>]]></summary>

</div>
<p>Things are heating up. I’m now 10lbs under what I started with as my 5 rep max for Squat. Still haven’t failed a rep. That’s almost certainly coming soon, though. The squats, and OH Press specifically are getting really spicy. I’ll hit 145 (full plates) on the OH Press tomorrow, actually, which will be a significant milestone.</p>
<p>Notice that I jumped 10lbs on squat between Wed and Sat, instead of the normal 5. That’s because I was at a new gym over Thanksgiving break, and could not for the life of me find 2.5lb plates. Finally found them because I wasn’t willing to jump that much for OH Press. One was on a random machine, and another was under a machine on the other side of the room. When I got home, I looked up how much a pair of 2.5lb plates from Rogue would cost. Seems like it might be worth the $8.</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Crossed the 1/2 way point in StrongLifts on Sat.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://gordonfontenot.com/images/StrongLifts/week-6.jpg" />

</div>
<p>Figured this would be a good point to figure out where I am.</p>
<p>When I started, I calculated my 5 rep max for each lift (Based on ~ 85% of my 1 rep max) as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Squat: 250lbs (Based on 300lb)</li>
<li>Bench: 230lbs (Based on 250lb)</li>
<li>Row: 190lbs (Based on 225b)</li>
<li>Overhead Press: 150lbs (Based on 175lbs)</li>
<li>Deadlift: 370lbs (Based on 435lbs)</li>
</ul>
<p>That means as of Saturday, I’m working at the following percentages of my original 5RM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Squat: 84%</li>
<li>Bench: 67%</li>
<li>Row: 71%</li>
<li>Overhead Press: 76%</li>
<li>Deadlift: 71%</li>
</ul>
<p>This is totally in line with how I feel with these lifts. My squat is harder than the others by far, while the bench is the easiest.</p>
<p>If I’m able to continue this linear progression (doubtful), where would my working reps and estimated 1RM be in another 6 weeks? Squat and deadlift add 30lbs every 2 weeks, while all of the other lifts add 15:</p>
<ul>
<li>Squat: 300lbs working, 353lb estimated 1RM (53lb improvement)</li>
<li>Bench: 200lbs working, 235lb estimated 1RM (15lb loss)</li>
<li>Row: 180lbs working, 211lb estimated 1RM (14lb loss)</li>
<li>Overhead Press: 160lbs working, 188lb estimated 1RM (13lb improvement)</li>
<li>Deadlift: 355lbs, 417lb estimated 1RM (18lb loss)</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn’t totally accurate, since this math is pretty much bullshit, and a 5x5 working weight isn’t quite the same thing as a 5 rep max, but it’s interesting that most of these weights don’t ever even hit my previous maxes. Hard to tell if this means I should have started heavier for these lifts, or if I started too heavy on the squats and the OH press.</p>]]></summary>

<p>Went to a new gym today and couldn’t find the squat rack. Had to do my squats in a 3D Smith machine, which was a complete and utter waste of time. How the hell do people use those things? I couldn’t find info on how much the bar weighed, but I seriously doubt it was 45lbs. So that’s a fairly questionable 195 for today. I’m going to push ahead and do 200 on Monday because I’m not that worried about it, but it’s frustrating to feel like I wasted a workout.</p>]]></summary>

</div>
<p>Last time, I said that I was worried that I was “too strong” for this program, which was both fairly arrogant, and also incorrect. My concern isn’t my strength, it’s that I’m outside of the “beginners gains” time frame. StrongLifts adds 5 lbs to each exercise every time you do it, which is an insanely fast progression. The weights are still light enough that it’s not hurting me yet, but I’m concerned about hitting a wall towards the end of the month. We’ll see though.</p>
<p>At the very least, it’s fun doing an actual structured program for once, and it’s great getting this much volume in, which wasn’t the case in CrossFit.</p>]]></summary>

<p>Weeks 2 and 3 of StrongLifts 5x5. Meant to post week 2 last week, but I totally forgot.</p>
<p>The weight for the squat is getting more respectable, but everything else is still insanely light. I’ve been finishing up my workouts with a 1k row on an erg machine just to get my heart rate up.</p>
<p>I’m starting to think I might be too strong for this program (#humblebrag). We’ll see how I feel a few weeks from now.</p>]]></summary>

With this program, I should be adding 5lbs to each movement every time I do them, so (hopefully) it won’t be too long before the volume catches up. It really is fun squatting this much, and I’m excited to do deadlifts at least once a week, as opposed to the once a month I was doing them before.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On March 23rd, 2010, I was in a bar with a couple of my friends. After a couple of beers, I began ranting about how I wanted an app on iPhone OS that could help me keep track of the beers I was drinking, along with tasting notes and ratings. It’s possible that I had maybe one beer too many, but when one of my friends suggested that I just build the app myself, I laughed it off and went on with my night. But when I woke up in the morning, it was still there in the back of my head. So on March 24th, 2010, I opened Xcode, started a project from a template, and started teaching myself Objective-C.</p>
<p>What I knew I’d get out of that project was a silly hobby that might make a few dollars. What I hoped for was a basic understanding about how to make applications, and maybe a nice challenge for weekend hacking. What I ended up with was a career change, and a newfound passion.</p>
<p>1 year ago today, I started as a professional iOS developer at <a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a> in Boston, MA. In that past year, I have grown tenfold professionally. I started attending <a href="http://www.cocoaheadsboston.org/">my local CocoaHeads chapter</a> in January, and attended my <a href="http://nsnorth.ca/">first professional conference</a> in April. In June I attended my first <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC</a> … <a href="http://altwwdc.com/">kinda</a>. And at the end of July, I started to <a href="http://buildphase.fm">co-host a podcast</a> with my good friend and colleague, <a href="https://twitter.com/hyperspacemark">Mark Adams</a>.</p>
<p>It’s been a hell of a fucking year. I’ve been almost unbelievably lucky over the past 12 months. <a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com/#our-team">My co-workers</a> are easily the smartest group of people I have ever met in my entire life. The projects I have been able to work on have been incredible learning experiences that have forced me to become a better developer on a daily basis. And for the first time in my life, I’m working in a job that I’m proud to call a career.</p>
<p>Can’t wait to see what happens next.</p>]]></summary>
