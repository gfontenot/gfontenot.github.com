          <p>Hey there! My name is Gordon Fontenot, and I’m a software developer living in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>I’m currently working at <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/">thoughtbot</a>, where I serve as the Mobile Development Director. This is a fancy-sounding title that means I write a bunch of iOS apps and manage thoughtbot’s distributed mobile team.</p>
<p>At work I write a lot of <a href="https://swift.org/">Swift</a>, and occasionally some <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html">Objective-C</a>. I’ve also been enjoying <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> recently, and have spent a bunch of time exploring <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> and <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> for web development.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I like to play around with <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> because talking about monads makes me sound smarter than I actually am. <a href="https://github.com/gfontenot/website-source">This website</a>, in fact, is generated using <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a>, which is a static site generator written in Haskell.</p>
<p>I’ve been fairly involved with the iOS open source community over the years. Most notably, I’m a core maintainer for <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/Argo">Argo</a>, a functional JSON parser for Swift that was heavily influenced by <a href="https://github.com/bos/aeson">Aeson</a> in Haskell and was itself the inspiration for a number of libraries in the Swift JSON parsing space. I’m also pretty proud of <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/Runes">Runes</a>, <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/Curry">Curry</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/Swish">Swish</a>.</p>
<p>I also try to do my personal work in the open when I can. One of my pet projects is <a href="https://github.com/gfontenot/featureless-void">my personal microblog</a>, which is written in Haskell using Yesod. I have also been working on <a href="https://github.com/gfontenot/reflow">reflow</a>, a Haskell tool for reflowing plain text with specific enhancements for dealing with emails. Finally, I’ve put a decent amount of work into my <a href="https://github.com/gfontenot/vim-xcode">vim-xcode</a> plugin, which is my attempt to escape the confines of Xcode in favor of Vim when doing iOS development.</p>
<p>I root for the <a href="http://houston.astros.mlb.com/index.jsp">Houston Astros</a>, and lift heavy weights at <a href="http://www.crossfitsouthlamar.com/">CrossFit South Lamar</a></p>
